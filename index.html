			<h2>Before you read</h2>
			<p> This resouce exists primarily as a means to better your understanding of the study abroad experience for the
			CUNY Hunter/Meiji Gakuin student exchange program. From the beginning processes to actually going abroad, I will 
			document what I feel is necessary for you to understand what this program is like. However, <strong>I do not represent either
			CUNY Hunter or Meiji Gakuin in any way, shape, or form.</strong> I intend to offer my experiences on things such 
			as my personal application process, preparing for actually going abroad, and being abroad. However, if you have questions
			pertaining to your personal application/financial aid, is it a conversation to be had with <strong>your</strong>
			advisors and NOT me.</p>
