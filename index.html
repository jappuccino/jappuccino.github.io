			<p> Testing the documentation of the journey to go and be abroad as a

			<h2>Before you read</h2>
			<p> This resouce exists primarily as a means to better your understanding of the study abroad experience for the
			CUNY Hunter/Meiji Gakuin student exchange program. It is completely anecdotal. From the beginning processes to actually going abroad, I will 
			document what I feel is necessary for you to understand what this program is like. However, <strong>I do not represent either
			CUNY Hunter or Meiji Gakuin in any way, shape, or form.</strong> I intend to offer my experiences on things such 
			as my personal application process, preparing for actually going abroad, and being abroad. However, if you have questions
			pertaining to your personal application/financial aid, is it a conversation to be had with <strong>your</strong>
			advisors and NOT me.</p>
			<h2>The Application Process</h3>
			<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/educationabroad/programs/semester-programs/semester-exchanges">
			Hunter College Semester Exchange Programs Page</a>
			<p> The link above will take you to see the available semester long programs available to
			to you as CUNY Hunter students. As CUNY students you are also able to apply to study abroad
			programs offered by other CUNYs. As of Spring 2019, The <strong>Meijo University</strong> 
			study abroad program was added to CUNY Hunter's list of programs. To my knowledge, only 1
			Hunter student is going to the Meijo program for Fall 2019. Do not confuse this website for Meijo 
			University related experiences as this is for <strong>Meiji Gakuin University</strong>,
			not Meijo University. While you may apply to Study Abroad programs from other CUNYs, not all
			of them are open to CUNY students. Some CUNYs reserve their programs specifically for their own
			students. I believe the Meiji Gakuin exchange program is exclusive to ONLY Hunter Students. I don't 
			know if this also applies to the Meijo program because it is the very first time the program is offered.
			I have previously thought of applying to CUNY CSI's Japanese exchange program based in Fukouka, so I 
			know that one was open to all CUNY students for certain (as of fall 2018). The Meiji Gakuin
			program is offered only in spring semesters (as of Spring 2019), this could be different for other
			programs. The link below will take you to the CUNY-wide study abroad progam search tool.</p>

			<h3>Your Application</h3>
			<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/educationabroad/repository/files/mgu-applications/MGU%20Fall%202019%20application.pdf">
			Example from 2019's Meiji Gakuin University International Student Program Application</a>
			<br>
			<p>This is basically what you'll see when you apply to the program. It is on you to ensure you are 
			eligible to apply to this study abroad program. Give yourself sufficient time to fill out the application. 
			You need to give the people writing you letters of recommendation <strong>time</strong> to write you letters. 
			You also need to write a personal statement. Anime is cool and all but I wouldn't write down that you want go to Japan solely because you watch anime.</p>
			<p>Note: Your initial application is only to be accepted as a nominee to actually apply to Meiji Gakuin.
			I believe they often only have 4 spots available. I heard some years not every spot was used up, I can say for 
			certain that this year there were more applicants than there were spots. You as a future applicant will have more 
			opportunities than past Hunter students because of the addition of the Meijo Exchange program.</p>
